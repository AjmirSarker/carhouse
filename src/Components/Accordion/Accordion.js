              <p>React is a JS Library which we use for building user interfaces.React use components which represent logical,reusable parts of the UI.In component react use JS function to return the expected outcome which is JSX.We can pass data data in a component as Props argument which we can use in UI.React also gives permission to create own states of components which is hook (useState).That's all i know so far. </p>

              <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
